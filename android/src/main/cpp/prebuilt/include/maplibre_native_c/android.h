/**
 * Initializes Android platform services that require access to the host app.
 *
 * This function is required before Android HTTP requests can validate TLS using
 * the app's platform trust policy. The host must package the
 * rustls-platform-verifier Android component in the APK or AAB.
 *
 * `jni_env` must be a `JNIEnv*` valid for the calling thread. `jni_class` is
 * accepted for static JNI binding adapters and ignored by the implementation;
 * direct C callers may pass null. `context` must be an Android
 * `android.content.Context` object. Any Context subtype may be passed; the
 * implementation resolves and stores the process application context when
 * initialization succeeds. All pointers are borrowed for the duration of the
 * call.
 *
 * May be called from any thread that is attached to the JVM.
 *
 * Returns:
 * - MLN_STATUS_OK when initialization succeeds or was already completed;
 * - MLN_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT when `jni_env` or `context` is null;
 * - MLN_STATUS_UNSUPPORTED when this library was not built for Android;
 * - MLN_STATUS_NATIVE_ERROR when Android verifier initialization fails.
